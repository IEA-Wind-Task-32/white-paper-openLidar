    \section*{About this document}
	This document provides an overview of our members' goals and the activities that we have already undertaken, and our plans for the future. They are intended to help stakeholders engage with the Task, provide feedback, and suggest new activities.
	
	An overview of the technical background to these activities is provided in an article written by the Task 32 Advisory Board in 2018 \cite{Clifton_2018_a} and in other references cited in the text.
	
	It is expected that this document will be updated annually. 
	
	\section*{Feedback}
	Feedback about the activities described here should be directed to the Task 32 Operating agents. Contact details can be found on the \href{https://community.ieawind.org/task32/about/contact}{Task 32 website}.
	
	\newpage
	\section*{List of Roadmaps}
	Task 32 has prepared roadmaps for several interrelated areas of wind lidar research and development:
	
	\tcblistof[]{roadmap}{}
	
	The roadmaps include activities led by Task 32 (shown in bold text) and by other groups (lighter text).

	\newpage
	\section*{What are the conditions where we want to build wind turbines?}
	
	Wind lidar can be used to measure wind resources and design conditions on land and offshore. %as part of a wind resource measurement campaign. 
	% While there is clear evidence of good agreement with traditional wind measurements from cup anemometers on meteorological masts, the fundamentally different measurement principle of a cup compared to a lidar results in some differences in complex terrain. Also, there are opportunities to use wind lidar in cold climates, for example to quantify the risk of wind turbine- or instrument icing, but these need to be explored in detail. These and other issues mean that there is a continued need for Task 32 members to actively cooperate in this area. Our common goal is the confident use of wind lidar to characterise operating conditions in all terrains and environments where wind turbines might be installed or operated.
	
	% -----------------------------------
	% Complex Terrain
	% -----------------------------------
	\subsection*{How do we interpret lidar data in complex terrain and complex flows?}

	In complex terrain, data from wind lidars can differ from cup anemometers as they use different measurement principles. But, wind lidar may be more flexible in complex terrain than tower-mounted anemometers. Task 32 collects, collates, and disseminates experience in the use of wind lidar in complex terrain and flow situations and thus enables its successful use in future.

	\newpage
	\subsection*{What are the opportunities and challenges when using lidar in cold climates?}
    
    Wind lidar have been used successfully in cold climates for many years. They have potential advantages over traditional met towers because they can be less prone to icing than traditional anemometers, and they are also easier to install in remote or hard-to-reach locations. There are also challenges with their use in cold climates such as keeping them ice- and snow-free, and of providing power supplies. Most of the challenges can be mitigated, meaning that there are clear opportunities for the wind energy community to exploit their advantages.
    
    Roadmap \ref{rm:coldclimates} describes Task 32's steps to support the effective use of wind lidar for wind energy in cold climates.

	\newpage
	\subsection*{How can we use wind lidar offshore, and how can we assess the performance of floating Lidar systems?}

	Floating wind lidar systems are cheaper and can be more flexibly used than lidar deployed to fixed platforms. For these and other reasons they have rapidly become the preferred tool for offshore wind resource assessment campaigns, and are also increasingly considered for alternative applications, e.g., power performance measurements.
	
	Task 32 supported the development of an offshore wind community and the creation of relevant recommended practices, leveraging support from the Carbon Trust. Roadmap \ref{rm:FLS} describes our past and future activities in this area.

	% Turbulence intensity for site assessment and loads certification

	\newpage
	\subsection*{How can we use lidar turbulence intensity data for site assessment and loads certification?}
	
    Wind lidar can provide data about the turbulence characteristics of wind \cite{Sathe_2015_a, Pena_2019_a}.
    
    There is an ongoing discussion about the relationship between lidar-derived turbulence information and data obtained from a cup anemometer, and how a wind turbine or wind plant responds to turbulence. These are being explored by several groups and it is hoped that in 2020 a joint Working Group will be established between Task 32 and others to align our activities and communication with stakeholders (Roadmap \ref{rm:TI}). 
    
    In addition, Task 32 plans to evaluate how lidar can contribute to load verification beyond providing providing turbulence information similar to conventional measurements.

	% Turbine and Plant Controls
	% -----------------------------------
	\newpage
	\section*{How can we use lidar to better operate wind turbines and plants?}
	Wind lidar can measure the winds in and around operating wind turbines and wind plants with unprecedented detail. Several reports have identified this as a key enabling technology for reducing the cost of wind energy in future \cite{Veers_2019_a}, and it forms a core part of Task 32's work.
    
	% -----------------------------------
	% Turbine Certification
	% -----------------------------------
	\subsection*{How do we certify and optimize turbines that use lidar-assisted controls?}
    Wind Lidar can provide information about incoming winds that can be used to make wind turbine control decisions. Implementing lidar-assisted control systems brings new challenges related to optimising the wind lidar that are used for this application, and to optimising the turbine controller and structure for the new opportunities presented by the turbine. 
    
    Task 32 seeks to enable communication and collaboration between wind turbine OEMs, lidar vendors, certification agencies, and the research community to address these challenges (Roadmap \ref{rm:LAC}).

	% Forecasting
	% -----------------------------------
	\newpage
	\subsection*{Forecasting}
    Because of their ability to look upwind, wind lidar can be used to forecast the winds arriving at wind plants or wind turbines 10 minutes or more in advance. This can be used to forecast energy output or make wind turbine- and wind farm- level control decisions. 
    
    Task 32 and Task 36 (Forecasting) worked together to establish the opportunities and needs for such minute-scale forecasts.

	% # Performance verification
	% -----------------------------------
	\newpage
	\section*{How can we use lidar for performance verification?}
	Wind lidars can be deployed on the ground or on nacelles for temporary power performance testing, or integrated into the turbine for continuous monitoring. They can characterise the wind shear and veer across the rotor disk, and thus are very useful for detailed performance studies.
	
	Task 32 supported validation of the uncertainty guidance in Edition 2 of the IEC 61400-121 Standard (2017) \cite{IEC_standard_61400-12-1_2017}. Since then the Task has looked at the use of nacelle-mounted lidar in complex terrain (Roadmap \ref{rm:NacelleMountedComplexTerrain}) and at using measurements in the wind turbine induction zone as input to a performance verification (Roadmap \ref{rm:InductionZone}).
	
    % -----------------------------------
	% ## Nacelle-mounted lidar in complex terrain
	% -----------------------------------
	\subsection*{Nacelle-mounted lidar in complex terrain}
	
	It can be challenging to relate wind conditions at a turbine's location to a reference wind measurement, especially in complex (inhomogenous) wind conditions associated with complex terrain. Instead, it may be possible to use nacelle-mounted lidar to measure upwind of the turbine and use that data for power performance verification.

	% ## Measurements in the induction zone
	% -----------------------------------
	\newpage
	\subsection*{Measurements in the induction zone of wind turbines}
	
	Current power performance standards require wind speed measurements for power performance verification to be taken at more than 2 diameters upwind. This is challenging with larger wind turbines.
	
	Task 32's experience suggests that it may be feasible to use measurements closer to the rotor to estimate free-stream wind conditions as part of power performance verification (Roadmap \ref{rm:InductionZone}).

	\newpage
	\section*{How can we collaborate on hardware and software?}
	
	Wind lidar are traditionally expensive devices that have been heavily optimized for specific applications. This also applies to software, which have been designed for certain workflows. This makes it challenging to test new ideas for wind lidar - as a new device is needed - or to share results between groups. 
	
	Task 32's members have been developing the frameworks and tools needed to collaborate on device hardware and software, and the software used to analyse results (Roadmap \ref{rm:Collaboration}).

	These activities will allow us to develop new wind lidar devices and trial new applications, and estimate the measurement performance of wind measurements in advance. Software tools will also capture and share some of the community's knowledge, reducing our reliance on today's experts.

    \newpage
	\section*{Other Activities}
	Task 32 offers its members a range of ways to exchange information and experience and disseminate their results to others.
	\subsection*{Commitment to Open Science}
    Task 32 leverages public money from many countries. We therefore aim to make our results freely accessible. To support this goal, we regularly update the  \href{https://community.ieawind.org/tasks/task32}{Task 32 website} with news and results from the Task's activities. In 2019 we started \href{https://community.ieawind.org/task32/ourlibrary/glossary/wgalphabeticaltab}{a glossary} on the website to capture some of the Task's knowledge and share it with others. We have also launched a Task 32 \href{https://zenodo.org/communities/ieawindtask32/}{document repository} where we collect material from our events and publish white papers.

    \subsection*{Events}
    We hold around three workshops every year. These are focussed on one specific application and are intended to make progress on a clear question. Many examples of these workshops can be found in the roadmaps.
    
    We also hold an annual General Meeting. The meeting is a mixture of presentations, discussion, and workshop sessions, and is attended by around 50 Task members from academia, industry, and government. The meeting includes results from the prior year's workshops and often triggers new activities. We will hold Task 32 General Meetings in Vienna in 2020 and Stuttgart in 2021.
    
    \subsection*{Advisory Board Meetings}
    Task 32 is facilitated by Operating Agents who are in turn supported by a 12-person Advisory Board drawn from the Task. The advisory board provides a way for the participants, Operating Agents, and other Tasks to quickly respond to changing situations and keep the Tasks activities relevant.

	% Get involved
	% -----------------------------------
	\section*{Providing input to future versions}
	The Task 32 roadmap has been developed by the Task 32 Operating Agent and Advisory Board based on input from the Task's stakeholders. The easiest way to help set the Task's future direction is therefore to get involved with the Task. We welcome participants at our events from any of Task 32's member countries, and encourage observers from the rest of the IEA wind member countries. We'd love to hear your opinions about what we should be doing, or ideas for solutions that benefit the whole community. Please see the \href{https://community.ieawind.org/task32/events/upcomingevents}{Task 32 website} for information about our events.
