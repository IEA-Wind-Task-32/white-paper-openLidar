# The OpenLidar initiative for wind lidar hardware and software collaboration
The OpenLidar initiative was started in 2015 by members of IEA Wind Task 32. Its goal is to encourage collaboration around wind lidar hardware and software by developing a modular wind lidar architecture and providing a framework for cooperation.
